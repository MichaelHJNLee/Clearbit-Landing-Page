The most important aspect of this take-home that I would want to improve is making my landing page responsive. Currently, the spacing of various dom elements can appear slightly misplaced depending on what size the user's window is.
Another improvement I would want to implement is adding some animations to the content of each section as the user scrolls.
I would also want refactor my html and javascript to React and use a CSS library instead of using vanilla.
Having sections of the navigation bar present a drop down menu on mouse hover would also be necessary.
